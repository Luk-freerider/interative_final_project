            <p class="lede">The federal government shutdown ended without closing Chicago's adaptive sports programs—but it exposed a deeper crisis affecting the athletes who depend on them.</p>

            <p>When the Chicago Skyhawks rolled onto the court at Jesse White Community Center for Wednesday night practice, everything looked normal. The wheelchair basketball team practiced their plays, took their shots, and finished another session. The government shutdown that had paralyzed federal agencies for weeks hadn't touched their programming.</p>

            <p>But behind the scenes, some athletes were struggling in ways most people never saw.</p>

            <div class="pullquote fade-in">
                "Some of our guys rely on SNAP to eat and survive. When that gets threatened, it affects people. We had players asking quietly for help."
                <div class="pullquote-attribution">— Pierre Nelson, Adaptive Sports Coordinator</div>
            </div>

            <p>Pierre Nelson, adaptive sports coordinator at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab and a coach within Chicago's wheelchair basketball community, said the shutdown revealed a critical gap: while adaptive sports programs operate almost entirely on private funding, the athletes themselves often depend on federal benefits just to survive.</p>

            <p>"We were able to keep everything running," Nelson said. "The lab is all privately funded. From the sports side, nothing stopped." But he quickly added: "Some of our guys rely on SNAP to eat and survive. When that gets threatened, it affects people. We had players asking quietly for help, and we were giving out donated gift cards and food."</p>

            <p>Debbie Hrncir, a Skyhawks member, described the psychological toll even when practices continued.</p>

            <div class="pullquote">
                "It's scary when you don't know if your benefits will be there. A lot of us are dealing with injuries or health issues. We depend on Medicaid, on food assistance. Sports help keep us going—but life outside the gym gets harder when the government shuts down."

                <h3>Historical Context: Why Adaptive Sports Lack Federal Support</h3>
                <p>Before the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA) of 1975—the precursor to today's IDEA—children with disabilities were routinely barred from public schools.</p>
                <p>Sports programs grew in similarly uneven ways, relying on local hospitals, nonprofits, and volunteers to create spaces for athletes with disabilities. This legacy of private funding continues today.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Linda Mastandrea, a two-time Paralympian, disability rights attorney, and former Shirley Ryan AbilityLab athlete, said the shutdown exposed problems that have existed for decades.</p>

            <p>"It's always been tough because so little comes from the government," she said. "When I made the 1992 Paralympic team, the U.S. Olympic Committee didn't fund us at all. We had to raise our own money just to compete for our country."</p>

            <div class="stat-highlight">
                <span class="stat-number">$0</span>
                <div class="stat-label">Amount of direct federal funding most community adaptive sports programs receive</div>
            </div>

            <p>While progress has improved—some Paralympians now receive stipends or health insurance—community-level programs still face inconsistent support. More concerning, Mastandrea said, is how broader federal cuts could ripple far beyond sports.</p>

            <p>"Many people with disabilities depend on Medicaid for health care or home services," she explained. "If those programs shrink, the impact is immediate. And if the Department of Education weakens its Special Education Division, students with disabilities lose protections. Those are direct, real consequences."</p>

            <p>Both Mastandrea and Nelson emphasized how deeply sports intersect with health, mobility, mental well-being, and long-term opportunity for people with disabilities.</p>

            <div class="pullquote">
                "Sports change lives. If the government invested consistently—even at the grassroots level—you'd see better health outcomes, more educational opportunities and greater employability for people with disabilities."

            <p>For Chicago's adaptive athletes, the shutdown ended without major damage to programming. But the concerns it exposed—about medical care, food security, and the near-absence of federal support for adaptive sports—remain, even as the gym lights stay on.</p>

            <p>"Put politics aside and put people first," Nelson said.</p>
